Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.

Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>

                                                <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.</p>
